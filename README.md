# PHP_Basic_Calculator (Project 1)

This guided project was instructed by Dani Krossing on Youtube https://youtu.be/STJfIu8T3kM.

This project outlines how to create a webpage that enables a user to input data for a basic add/subtract calculation and obtain results after submission of two data pieces.

The project includes HTML and PHP code within two .php files. 
The local server installed on my Mac is MAMP.
